Grandfather, Grandmother, Joe and Corinna, Rebecca and Frances, and Jeanette
arrived in Egypt from Veince (sic) November 4 1906.  Some of us stayed in 
Cairo.  The rest at Helouan, while Grandfather and Joe hunted for Dahabeyah's
up and down the banks of the nile - plenty of Dahabeyah's - but all too dear
for us - at last when Joe had planned to go to Assouan to take the old
"Abou Simbel", we heard through Michael Casira a Greek Antiquity
merchant in Cairo, that a countryman of his one, Georges Spiliotti had
a good boat the price of which came some where near our figures - and
while Joe and Corinna were at Sakkara, spending Sunday with the Quibell's
Grandfather went to see the boat, and telegraphed to Joe, that it was a
lucky find.
[tab] The "Stella" is much bigger than any boat we have ever had before
and there is plenty of room in her for us all, with a possible guest - 
Rebecca is to have a room to herself opposite Grandfathers, while Frances and
Jeanette have the large room in the stern.
The Greek Spiliottis - is a sharp, hard, miser, and a Greek to boot, a 
combination hard to beat, and we didn't beat him - after many interviews
in his shop [opposite Shepheard's] we at last came to an understanding and

drew up the contract, which was more formal than heretofore, having
various lawyerlike clauses, and items such as "In consideration of" etc etc

Merchant, near neighbor of the Greek.

[illegible] on the boat, while the Ramadan festival ended and Byuram began, and
[illegible] dawdling ways of the Orient prevailed, and our words of hustle were
[illegible] ied and of no avail - the pump didn't work, three windows, only
[illegible] easted of sashes - two wouldn't open - one wouldn't shut, likewise
[illegible] doors would fly open - or couldn't be made to - the bathtub was a disgrace

[illegible] forks and knives etc was a surprise - fairly complete - and sheets and

bought the bulk of our stores, while Grandma and Corinna looked afer
the "Fleurent" items, which came to about $160.
Abdulla and Abdulrachman arrived on the 21st and with them came *The dead woman (inserted horizontally in two lines on left margin/page in two lines)
the "old folk's spring beds, and the babies bath tub - we were then
ready to start up the river - but delays prevented, and yet, more
delays [we never got off so quickly though]
At last on Friday *23 (inserted above line of text) we left the bank and waited an hour near *1st day 13 miles (inserted horizontally in margin two lines of text) 
Giserah for two of the crew, and about 3.30 reached Helouan, from
whence the voyage was really to commence.
The little people, with Corinna and Jeanette, came on board next morning,
and our departure was delayed, by the non appearance, of the small felluka
with the head, which was to have followed us, from Cairo, with the
second Reis and two more crew.  Frances was recovering from a
slight illness, and we were just as well pleased to stay one night, more
within a Doctors reach.

We came to anchor at sundown, near Es=Saf, and the next day
Monday 26th, a strong South wind kept us all day lying there in *4th day 19 miles (inserted horizontally in left margin two lines of text)
a poor position - which we bettered towards sunset, by crossing the 
river - a fierce rain squall was an unpleasant feature of the 
afternoon.
Tuesday 27th. South wind.  Joe and Corinna, Rebecca and Grandma,  *5th day (inserted horizontally in left margin one line of text)

Mahomet Abdul Rasull from Shellal whose
uncle had left him alone in Cairo and gone

we consented to take him - Later we found 
that he could read and write Arabic and was
very smart and quick to learn - 
[tab] Abdallah put in an appearance one day only
and then took to his bed where he stayed in
the dark until tonight when it was decided to
send him home as far as Luxor with Joe who
went on the night train.

Friday 30th And another day at Kafr-Amar *8th day (inserted horizontally in left margin one line of text)
Strong wind storm from the south.
The crew are getting uneasy at the delay as
they are hired for a month only (as we suppose)
and as they mostly live up the river they wish
the extra time after arriving at Luxor, to be with
their homes.  Yesterday the writer amused himself
making a box for Joes canvasses (sic) and today 
he made Giney's house - of cardboard - but no
sooner was it done than she wanted - front door
chimney - glass windows - steps - bath tub for dolls
etc - truly one want makes another.
Dowie made a trip to Wastor for bread.  Rained again
last night.

Saturday Dec. 1st [tab] This day opens with a *9th Day 1 mile (inserted in two lines in left margin)

we made another mile. *or so (inserted in line) - Rain - 
[tab] We sent Dowie and Yuseff to Wasta to
try to get a telegram to Joe and find
more bread etc. Expect him back by midnight.
[tab] The Reis says that this weather
was expected at Cairo and that Prof
Syce and others were waiting for it
to blow out - We are ahead of them
and saving hotel bills in Cairo, if that is
any consolation.

Thursday Dec. 6. [tab] Day opens with *12 (strikethrough)(insert four over the two) 14th day (inserted in left margin horizontally)
a strong wind from the South - dust

[tab] Dowie returned about 4 P.M. - over a day
waiting to hear from Joe - no answer to
our telegram - don't understand it.
We must wait until we get to Feshen

[tab] Mr. Davis's boat is being towed past us
going up - too far off to recognize anyone but

We made about 10 (strikethrough)(insert five over zero) 5 miles today and banked a few miles 
above Wasta - East bank.

Some trouble getting an early start.
10.45 we made a start with a fair wind and
reached Mahaglia at 3.15 where we found a post 
card and a telegram from Joe giving us two weeks
later news from him - from thence with a gailing (sic) wind 
we fetched up at Sharona about 6 miles farther on -
after dark. Being tired of doing nothing the old
folks went to bed early and so ends this day.

The sheep above mentioned turns out to be a fish a

We ask the Captain to have the boat moved
a short distance up stream to a better place
as this bank we are at is high *and dusty (inserted above line) and hard
to climb.  Three of the men absoluely refuse
to work - claiming a money dispute and when
the Capt threatens to discharge them at once
most (strikethrough)(insert) 4 others of (strikethrough) the (strikethrough) others (strikethrough) say they would be afraid to

Sunday Continued
Dec. 16 [tab] Instead of paying the men 1 1/2 L (British pound) the Moudir *24th day Continued (inserted horizontally in left margin two lines)
ordered that they be paid 100 (100 written over 100 to clarify number) P.T. and discharged
which leaves us here short of men to get to
Assiout and for which we blame the Moudir in as
much as the mens time of one month had not
expired.  If we get a good wind we will try to
get to Assiout where with the help of a sheep
and a new crew which the Capt. will get we
hope to continue our voyage.

still at Deir Mues. Dowie and the gov. decide to go
to Assuit and try to get word to Joe - train goes at 11.45
but is 1 1/2 hours late.  We arrived at Luxor (strikethrough)(insert) Assuit with a
sailor whom the Capt. sent to get more crew - I doubt his
finding them.  We got about 40 letters and several of
Sais's clippings - no word from Joe later than Dec. 5.
[tab] Dowie & (diff symbol) I come back arriving at Deir Moes at about
9 P.M. - no Yusseff & Capt. who agreed to meet us there - we
got a boy & (diff symbol) a gaffir who led us a weary journey over

we had left the boat and it was gone - "What shall we do"

[tab] What the ladies have to say I hear but think
they have written somewhere - Certainly they must have
been worried - I knew nothings about moving the
boat untill after we were in the train for Assuit
except that Dowie said that if "there was a good
wind the Capt would move the boat father up to
a better place & (diff symbol) nearer the Station and that he

took the liberty without cousaltation (sic) to start 
the boat with practically no crew - left no word
at the station - but was in hopes to reach Deirout
in time to telegraph us at Assiut of the change - 
but unfortunately he got on a sand bar just
before reacing (sic) the shore - which when reached we
rushed up to the RR Station in hopes to get us 
out of the Cars there - but he was too late - 
a miscalculation and misadventure.  11.15 am we start from *here (inserted under the line)
and make about 18 miles

bad sailing - the course was nearly a double (underlined) letter
S. at about 11 a.m. just at the last of bad
tracking place we found Eufordi with two sailors
that he had got at Assuit.
[tab] Yesterday while Dowie and the Gov. was away & (diff symbol) the
vessel was sailing it got aground just before
reaching Deirout - all the women on board

themselves, tearing & (diff symbol) wetting their clothes but succeeded
To day the Capt & (diff symbol) Yuseff with Dowie & (diff symbol) Abdulachman
towed the boat a long way while the Gov & (diff symbol) Mahomet

an Austrian prince came up behind us
After dinner the Gov. changed his shirt & (diff symbol) costume

the wind was failing - we went through all
night and there on the bank was Joe who
had been chasing us down the river for two
days - we were all very (underlined) glad to see him - 
We moored at the bank some way above
the bridge.  The two sailors then left us - the
money question being the matter - as is usual.
[tab] P.M. Mother & (diff symbol) I went to find the am. consul
to have him witness the deed Aunty sent
us - He had just gone to Cairo for two

owner time to get here at about noon.  It seems that 
by assistance of Reis of Am. Consul he had obtained
six men but as he did not tell of we supposed it was 
at last night when he said he had no (underlined) men - so we telegraphed
great disturbance in the boat - *Capts. (insert) Cook left -

Maragha - stuck but not bad, this makes the

12.15 The Dongola passed us just above
Sohag amidst great excitement - a native
boat getting in both of our ways.
We kept on until 2 a.m. with a failing 
wind a (sic) reached within four miles of Nag Hamadi

Tuesday Dec. 25 [tab] Christmas day opens with no *33rd day (inserted horizontally in left margin one line)
wind to speak of - we got some milk and
begin to pole *8 a.m. (inserted slightly above line) The children had their stockings
hung and when dressed in their white clothes they
came out in great excitement to see what Santa
Claus had left.  They said "where are the other presents
that he had" but on the whole they were very well 
satisfied and enjoyed passing to the crew candy
cigarettes etc to the crew who passed the usual thanks
[tab] With calm and puffs of wind we kept
in motion most of the day, we had
an exciting time colliding with a
native boat which tried to cross our
bow.  The native shouts required wind
enough to have filed our sails if properly
directed.
[tab] We reached the R.R. bridge at
Nagh Hamandi early in the night

south wind (our same old friend who

Dongola.  The Baron & (diff symbol) his Sect make us 
a call before we are hardly moored & (diff symbol) invite
us to a walk & (diff symbol) to go aboard his boat.

Thursday Dec. 27 [tab] Day opens quiet. *35th day Nagh Hamadi (inserted horizontally in left margin two lines)
The Baron took a tug this am at 6 - & (diff symbol) left.
We priced a tug to Luxor 15 L (pound) and 10 L (pound) to Kennea and
we told them to go to - --(combined - but longer length making one line) The wind at night fall
was Westerly and we had hopes but it did not
fill the bill so Joe takes the train at 8.52 for
Luxor and we remain to wait for wind.

Friday Dec 28 Day opens light wind S.E. - at 8 o'clk *36th day (inserted horizontally in left margin one line)
men took rope & (diff symbol) tracked until about 10.30 - Our old
friend Alobi passed us in a tug.  He is Captain now and
Page Blank:
is employed at Esna at the building of the new R.R *36th day Contd (inserted horizontally in left margin one line)
bridge there. [tab] At 1. oclk a gentle breeze
struck in from the North and "we sailed"
We reached and went around the bad
water.  A more serious quarrel occurred
between the two Reis's - I pity our Reis he
is not having a very good time and so far
until this time has kept his temper very well.
We plugged along with a light wind and about
dark Yusseff was sent ashore to buy milk as the
Reis said that if we had a good wind he did not
wish to delay in the morning.  We drifted some
way beyond the small village and began to 
think that something had happened to him - 
the sailors said so and that it was a bad town.
But we sent the boat ashore and after a time
he appeared.  Not long after in trying to get
beyond a point of land with light wind the
current carried us off a back and we collided
with a native freight boat which was very close
under our stern - we both met - turned around
Page Blank:
with our sails aback - parted and met again *36 contd near Fan (inserted horizontally in left margin two lines)
and the stern outrigger of the ghagger went clear 
though our "cook shop" scaring its boss so much as
all hands. We then tied up for repairs at writing 8. P.M.
There seems to be a large village across the
river with perhaps 100 dogs and 5 children to each one
all barking and shrieking - having a fantasiea 
perfect bealance (sic).  On the whole an exciting day.

Saturday Dec. 29 [tab] This day opens fine with a *37th day (inserted horizontally in left margin one line)
light Westerly wind and as far as it goes is good
for us - By poleing tracking & (diff symbol) the wind we make
a mile or so and at 10 o'clk we are again fast
to the mud on the opposite bank and by good
luck avoided running into any boats but the banks
suffered some.  At 9 P.M. we are sailing along
finely and approaching Kenna and hope to make a 
good run tonight.  So far only 3 Dahabieyahs have passed
us up 2 with steam and 2 down one with steam.
Where is Prof Syce? - We sailed all night with
a light wind and at 6.30 anchored opposite Ballas
and Yuseff went ashore for milk.
Page Blank:
Sunday Dec. 30 [tab] Day opens fine but with a light *38th day at Ballas in A.M. Koos P.M. (inserted horizontally in left margin four lines)
wind which we hope will strengthen as the day goes on.
8.30 we start slowly - and by sailing - poleing and
tracking with a failing wind at 3.30 we reach
Koos where we expect to spend the night unless
a good wind comes up, in which case we will
start.  Corinna Doe I and 3 men took a long
walk to the station and wired Joe of our position.

Monday Dec. 31st [tab] This day opens still with *39th day Koos Till 6.15 P.M. (inserted horizontally in left margin three lines)

stop at another mud bank just around a corner.
6.15 a huffey West wind put in and we started off 
with great delight in hopes of reaching Luxor this year.
Dowie has festooned the upper deck with Suset branches

Backing and filling all day and trying to get
over all the hooks in the river, with occasional

up temporally (sic) at the shore in sight of Luxor and
by guess .4 miles distant - no milk, whiskey, chicken
or any thing else provided for dinner and we
are all pretty huffey and generally disgreantled (sic). 
Our upper deck is all festooned for the day and it 
will be a past member when we get up.
After the moon arose we had an East wind and
tried it again but the wind soon died out and
we only crossed the river and came to anchor
We have done our d-st but can't fetch it
